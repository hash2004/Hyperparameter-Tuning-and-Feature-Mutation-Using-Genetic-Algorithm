# Decision Tree Hyperparameter Optimization Results

## Overview

This document summarizes the outcomes of the genetic algorithm employed for optimizing the hyperparameters of a Decision Tree classifier. The process is critical for enhancing the model's prediction accuracy. The table below encapsulates the iterative journey towards optimal hyperparameter configurations, detailing the progression of fitness values across generations and highlighting the instances of algorithmic restarts necessitated by fitness stagnation.

## Interpretation

The data presented in the table reveals nuanced behaviors of the genetic algorithm's search process in the hyperparameter space. Experiment 1, with the highest number of generations, achieved a relatively stable convergence, although necessitating multiple restarts to overcome local optima. Experiments 2 and 3, with fewer generations, illustrate the challenges faced in balancing exploration and exploitation within the hyperparameter landscape.

These insights serve to guide further refinement of the optimization process and offer a transparent evaluation of the algorithm's performance across different experimental setups.

*Note: The restart points indicate generations at which the algorithm's fitness did not improve, prompting a restart to reinvigorate the search process.*
